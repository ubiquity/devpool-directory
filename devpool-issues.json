On the contrary, If Dollar token USD price <1$ (on a secondary market) then arbitragers are incentivised to:\r\na) Buy cheap Dollar token on a secondary market\r\nb) Redeem Dollar token for collateral worth 1 USD in the [LibUbiquityPool](https://github.com/ubiquity/ubiquity-dollar/blob/0a230f977ad91bbfb01dd28bc1d2ea77faed5237/packages/contracts/src/dollar/libraries/LibUbiquityPool.sol)\r\n\r\nOn early project stage any large swap may affect the Dollar token price greatly and the pool (where the swap occurred) may remain unbalanced for a long time which in turn depegs the Dollar token.\r\n\r\nAs a part of this issue we should create an arbitrage bot (i.e. `nodejs` app) which could be run on VPS or any suitable PAAS (heroku, cloudflare, etc...) to catch arbitrage opportunities in order to keep the Dollar token USD pegged on early project stage.\r\n\r\nWhat should be done:\r\n1. Create a new `nodejs` app that will catch arbitrage opportunities for the Dollar token\r\n2. Add unit tests for basic functionality\r\n3. Prepare a clear README of how to run the bot\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n- It makes sense to create the arbitrage bot in a separate repository.\r\n- Deployed contract addresses (mainnet): [here](https://github.com/ubiquity/ubiquity-dollar/blob/0a230f977ad91bbfb01dd28bc1d2ea77faed5237/packages/contracts/broadcast/Deploy001_Diamond_Dollar_Governance.s.sol/1/run-latest.json)\r\n","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ubiquity/ubiquity-dollar/issues/958/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ubiquity/ubiquity-dollar/issues/958/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ubiquity/ubiquity-dollar/issues/939","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ubiquity/ubiquity-dollar","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ubiquity/ubiquity-dollar/issues/939/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ubiquity/ubiquity-dollar/issues/939/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ubiquity/ubiquity-dollar/issues/939/events","html_url":"https://github.com/ubiquity/ubiquity-dollar/issues/939","id":2309724903,"node_id":"I_kwDOF4fVBs6Jq5rn","number":939,"title":"Investigate and confirm the behaviour for new staking users for uad-contracts and diamond","user":{"login":"gitcoindev","id":88761781,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg4NzYxNzgx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/88761781?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gitcoindev","html_url":"https://github.com/gitcoindev","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gitcoindev/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gitcoindev/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gitcoindev/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gitcoindev/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gitcoindev/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gitcoindev/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gitcoindev/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gitcoindev/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gitcoindev/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"open","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":10,"created_at":"2024-05-22T06:55:19Z","updated_at":"2024-09-27T20:05:30Z","closed_at":null,"author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","active_lock_reason":null,"body":"Right now the behaviour for new staking users is this one:\r\n1) User deposits 1000 `UAD3CRV LP` to https://etherscan.io/address/0xc251ecd9f1bd5230823f9a0f99a44a87ddd4ca38 for 1 week\r\n2) User waits for 1 week\r\n3) User withdraws 1000 `UAD3CRV LP` and gets 178 `UAD3CRV LP` + 72 `UBQ`.

However, the Sherlock report is actually wrong and the vulnerability described must not be considered as an issue in the first place, so the collateralEnabled check should not be added on collecting redemptions.\r\n\r\nEnabling/disabling collaterals allows the protocol to add or remove supported collaterals, not to be used under uncertain situations, such as a hack. In such type of situations, the `isRedeemPaused` check can be enabled to prevent users from redeeming if something wrong is currently  happening.\r\n\r\nThe problem with adding the `collateralEnabled` check here is that if Ubiquity decides to disable a collateral in the future, some redemptions might be already queued, so users won't be able to withdraw their funds.\r\n\r\n\r\nRecommendation: Remove the `collateralEnabled` check for collecting redemptions.\r\n\r\n_Originally posted by @0xadrii in https://github.com/ubiquity/ubiquity-dollar/pull/894#discussion_r1572571068_\r\n

Contributor reputation: we can track a contributor's earnings over time and extend credit based on their monthly average earnings. For example, a user earns on average $5000 a month for the last three months, so they can borrow $5000 from us at X% APR if they need liquidity. Not sure what a good minimum threshold is but obviously the shorter the riskier. We could start a pilot with a whitelist of OG contributors first. We can consider only allowing card minting to disincentivize the use of leverage/trading with the funds. \n\n2. Permits: wages are distributed through our system and could be used for automatic payback (or garnishing wages) which could help make financing easier to payback. \n\nI think the biggest piece of advantage is the reputation system though.

Claim the permit by transferring the permit reward to the treasury wallet\r\n2. If the step-1 is successful, order the virtual card at Reloadly\r\n\r\nThe problem is that the transaction isn't atomic because each step happens in a different system. Step-2 can fail while still leaving the permit amount in the treasury. Why would step-2 fail? There could be one of the many reasons.\r\n\r\n- virtual card suddenly becoming out of stock\r\n- any network error on user side or Reloadly side\r\n- user closing browser before the permit transaction confirmation\r\n- change in the best picked card, suddenly a better card becomes available or currently picked card becomes unavailable\r\n- [RPC-handler](https://github.com/ubiquity/rpc-handler) failing to find rpc for backend to use, or if it finds one but the rpc stops working\r\n\r\nCurrently, the solution to this problem is manual. It is either a manual refund or manual resending of the card order request to `/post-order` with some parameters (productId, tx hash, country).\r\n\r\nWe can improve this by implementing one of the following solutions.\r\n- a manual refund can become automatic by issuing a new permit of the same amount\r\n- resend the mint request to backend to `/post-order`\r\n\r\nI am inclined towards resending the mint request. One problem is that `/post-order` needs the transaction hash of the permit transfer to the treasury. Sometimes you will have it, and you can store it in the cookies/local storage. But sometimes you will not have it and you will have to read it either from blockchain or ask the user to manually insert the transaction hash to retry minting. I think you can read it from blockchain by looking into [permit2 events](https://gnosisscan.io/address/0x000000000022d473030f116ddee9f6b43ac78ba3#events) \r\n\r\nThe goal of this issue is to implement a mechanism to resend the mint request or a better solution if you can think of one. \r\n\r\nSince the best-picked virtual card can change in this duration, a better option is to rename the mint button to \"Retry Mint\" and let the user click first so that user can see they are ordering a different card now. \r\n\r\nPlease note that the virtual cards feature is present in `beta` branch at the moment. But it can move to development branch anytime. So, keep an eye on that and open a PR accordingly.","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ubiquity/pay.ubq.fi/issues/291/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ubiquity/pay.ubq.fi/issues/291/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ubiquity/pay.ubq.fi/issues/289","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ubiquity/pay.ubq.fi","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ubiquity/pay.ubq.fi/issues/289/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ubiquity/pay.ubq.fi/issues/289/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ubiquity/pay.ubq.fi/issues/289/events","html_url":"https://github.com/ubiquity/pay.ubq.fi/issues/289","id":2491491906,"node_id":"I_kwDOI-EJSM6UgSZC","number":289,"title":"Generate rolled up payouts","user":{"login":"rndquu","id":119500907,"node_id":"U_kgDOBx9waw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/119500907?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rndquu","html_url":"https://github.com/rndquu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rndquu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rndquu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rndquu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rndquu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rndquu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rndquu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rndquu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rndquu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rndquu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":5347111904,"node_id":"LA_kwDOI-EJSM8AAAABPrZz4A","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ubiquity/pay.ubq.fi/labels/Time:%20%3C1%20Week","name":"Time: <1 Week","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null}],"state":"open","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":22,"created_at":"2024-08-28T08:57:47Z","updated_at":"2024-10-01T21:40:34Z","closed_at":null,"author_association":"MEMBER","active_lock_reason":null,"body":"Depends on https://github.com/ubiquibot/conversation-rewards/issues/64\r\n\r\n[This](https://github.com/ubiquibot/conversation-rewards/issues/64) issue adds the \"reward amount rollup\" feature which adds a new DB table `rewards`.\r\n\r\nOverall right now (when https://github.com/ubiquibot/conversation-rewards/issues/64 is solved) there are 2 tables related to contributors' rewards:\r\n1. `rewards`: matches a single github issue with a single user reward\r\n2. `permits`: stores generated accumulated rewards\r\n\r\nThe plan is to allow contributors to select the reward amount they want to redeem (either via permits either via gift cards).\r\n\r\nExample flow with permits:\r\n1.

Can propose co-marketing (and ideally even piloting with our system) so that we can have more users. \r\n\r\nTo start, we can link users to the Gnosis Pay website for registration, and then potentially have the card details displayed on the rewards UI. We should have a \"claim to Gnosis Card\" button once the user's card is set up. \r\n\r\nWe can consider a separate page (separate UI code) to streamline the logic and ensure that Gnosis Pay users UI isn't co-mingled with the prepaid card logic.

Not to mention that unit/snapshort/e2e testing is complicated in such codebase.\r\n\r\nWe need a JS framework with these features:\r\n- it should take 1 hour to grasp the docs\r\n- popular\r\n- good for small scale apps\r\n- team members and contributors should be comfortable to use it\r\n\r\nI've personally heard good reviews about:\r\n- https://preactjs.com/\r\n- https://alpinejs.dev/\r\n\r\nSince I personally have more experience with react then, perhaps, https://preactjs.com/ worth a shot.\r\n\r\nSo as a part of this issue we should refactor https://github.com/ubiquity/ts-template to use a selected JS framework in a **structured** way:\r\n- pages\r\n- components\r\n- services\r\n- store\r\n- utils\r\n- test\r\n- etc...","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ubiquity/ts-template/issues/67/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ubiquity/ts-template/issues/67/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ubiquity/ts-template/issues/61","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ubiquity/ts-template","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ubiquity/ts-template/issues/61/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ubiquity/ts-template/issues/61/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ubiquity/ts-template/issues/61/events","html_url":"https://github.com/ubiquity/ts-template/issues/61","id":2565894806,"node_id":"I_kwDOJGfp8c6Y8HKW","number":61,"title":"Automatic sync v2","user":{"login":"rndquu","id":119500907,"node_id":"U_kgDOBx9waw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/119500907?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rndquu","html_url":"https://github.com/rndquu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rndquu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rndquu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rndquu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rndquu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rndquu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rndquu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rndquu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rndquu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rndquu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":5440623867,"node_id":"LA_kwDOJGfp8c8AAAABRElU-w","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ubiquity/ts-template/labels/Time:%20%3C1%20Day","name":"Time: <1 Day","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null},{"id":6498575088,"node_id":"LA_kwDOJGfp8c8AAAABg1hi8A","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ubiquity/ts-template/labels/Priority:%202%20(Medium)","name":"Priority: 2 (Medium)","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null},{"id":7519278198,"node_id":"LA_kwDOJGfp8c8AAAABwC8Udg","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ubiquity/ts-template/labels/Price:%20400%20USD","name":"Price: 400 USD","color":"1f883d","default":false,"description":null}],"state":"open","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":19,"created_at":"2024-10-04T09:21:28Z","updated_at":"2024-10-14T17:01:57Z","closed_at":null,"author_association":"MEMBER","active_lock_reason":null,"body":"[This](https://github.com/ubiquity/ts-template/pull/56) PR introduced a [workflow](https://github.com/zyrafal/ts-template/blob/89b942ed3a2d87c00f2bf61057586e0ead5119d3/.github/workflows/sync-template.yml) for syncing https://github.com/ubiquity/ts-template repository template with all of our other repositories.\r\n\r\nThere are a couple of issues:\r\n1.

For \"auto sync\" to work we need to keep the [sync-template.yml](https://github.com/ubiquity/audit.ubq.fi/blob/205cc736abac8019debc28ab2d4a2d21344d3cef/.github/workflows/sync-template.yml) in all of our repositories\r\n\r\n\"Auto sync\" may be useful for small changes like CI updates, ts config edits, etc... [Such](https://github.com/ubiquity/work.ubq.fi/pull/101) PRs introduce too many changes which are hard to debug and fix.\r\n\r\nWhat should be done:\r\n1. Remove [sync-template.yml](https://github.com/ubiquity/ts-template/blob/858ab74ead68d8954a8e32074c9b0eb805c5b6ca/.github/workflows/sync-template.yml) from all of our repositories and keep it only in a single place like https://github.com/ubiquity/.github\r\n2.

For example mine is 776, so if I had the correct ratio (I don't) I could get paid 7.76 xDAI up to once a week for retweeting. \n\nThen people like [my friend with 183.8k followers](https://x.com/eth_apple?s=21&t=bdMjuqzO5LYxLUsloRROxQ) could get paid up to 1,838 xDAI per week etc. \n\n### View Count\n\nI see some of his posts get around 800 views and some get like 27k views. Perhaps it's smarter to pay based on views (we can probably get this from the API)\n\nMaybe we can value a view at 0.05 xDAI or something.\n\n### Architecture\n\nI'm unsure what the simplest implementation looks like, but we could probably start semi manually and figure it out from there. \n\nMaybe a minimal UI that lists the Twitter handle of the retweeters of the previous month, and calculates the rewards next to them.\n\nWe need to monitor our tweets for retweets. For the first step we can manually handle payouts. Later if we get traction we can automate with permit payments.

here:\r\nhttps://github.com/ubiquity/rpc-handler/blame/7a24b8a491695bb2121d01e44f4e7a4745ec61e7/types/rpc-handler.ts#L93\r\nAnd is there a reason why we didn't just extend the BaseProvider from ethers?\r\n\r\nImprovements:\r\n- When the RPC request fails it retries with the list of RPCs which includes this same RPC that failed, we should skip it instead.\r\n- If a RPC fails a couple of times even across different requests, we can mark it as offline and not use it anymore\r\n","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ubiquity/rpc-handler/issues/56/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ubiquity/rpc-handler/issues/56/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ubiquity/rpc-handler/issues/54","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ubiquity/rpc-handler","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ubiquity/rpc-handler/issues/54/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ubiquity/rpc-handler/issues/54/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ubiquity/rpc-handler/issues/54/events","html_url":"https://github.com/ubiquity/rpc-handler/issues/54","id":2579280825,"node_id":"I_kwDOLaI9PM6ZvLO5","number":54,"title":"Unreliable","user":{"login":"0x4007","id":4975670,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ5NzU2NzA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4975670?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/0x4007","html_url":"https://github.com/0x4007","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/0x4007/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/0x4007/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/0x4007/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/0x4007/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/0x4007/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/0x4007/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/0x4007/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/0x4007/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/0x4007/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":6648751898,"node_id":"LA_kwDOLaI9PM8AAAABjEvnGg","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ubiquity/rpc-handler/labels/Priority:%204%20(Urgent)","name":"Priority:

handler is now a proxy which routes on-chain read/writes through it handling retry and reselection logic. The original issue was that `eth_call is not supported` was being thrown by some endpoints due to network sync issues on the provider's part. While the proxy approach resolves this indirectly it could be beneficial to deal with the underlying issue.\r\n\r\nWhile we can do our best to serve a healthy provider from the beginning it's possible a user call may still fail although with an improved health check this is far less likely and with our proxy the other endpoints should be also be perfectly healthy\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n#### Option 1\r\n\r\nCurrent: fetch block number and ensure it's valid data\r\nProposed: block number + permit2 read op\r\n\r\nThe health check can be improved by a number of methods but one that makes sense to me is repeating the `eth_call` which highlighted the issue originally\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nThe downsides with this is:\r\n\r\n1. That it has been proven that the same `eth_call` can and will fail intermittently even with some of the best RPCs for that network, so would require best-of 3 calls for example \r\n2. If checks are 'fragile' like this then it's entirely possible we encounter a 'no providers found' scenario in error\r\n3. The more checks added the higher the chance the above happens\r\n4. It's still possible for a call to fail due to provider error\r\n5. The more calls we add the higher the network demand on load\r\n6. ^ the slower we are to returning a provider\r\n7. Our data/provider is static after load unless re-rendered/recalled\r\n\r\nThe upsides with this is:\r\n\r\n8. We are guaranteed healthy endpoints\r\n9. Less chance retry logic will be executed\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n#### Option 2\r\n\r\nAdopt a polling-based approach, first gather our healthy endpoints and then poll them according to config settings ensuring that they remain healthy and pop them if they fault. We could collect the first pool using just the block number check and then any that make it to round two are polled with `eth_call` read ops.\r\n\r\nDownsides:\r\n- Perpetual read ops called\r\n- runtime network demand depending on settings and amount of providers to poll\r\n- We may hit call limits with our check and serve it for the user to get rate limited (low chance)\r\n\r\nUpsides:\r\n- Dynamic health status\r\n- Potentially makes retry logic obsolete\r\n- network load demand is on par with option 1\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nOption two would require a pretty big overhaul of the current system as opposed to option one\r\n\r\nAny other suggestions are welcome\r\n\r\n_related issue context https://github.com/ubiquity/pay.ubq.fi/issues/235#issuecomment-2235154700_","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ubiquity/rpc-handler/issues/30/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ubiquity/rpc-handler/issues/30/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ubiquity/safe.ubq.fi/issues/3","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ubiquity/safe.ubq.fi","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ubiquity/safe.ubq.fi/issues/3/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ubiquity/safe.ubq.fi/issues/3/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ubiquity/safe.ubq.fi/issues/3/events","html_url":"https://github.com/ubiquity/safe.ubq.fi/issues/3","id":2469641605,"node_id":"I_kwDOMNZuas6TM72F","number":3,"title":"Save EOA to a DB","user":{"login":"rndquu","id":119500907,"node_id":"U_kgDOBx9waw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/119500907?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rndquu","html_url":"https://github.com/rndquu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rndquu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rndquu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rndquu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rndquu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rndquu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rndquu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rndquu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rndquu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rndquu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"open","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":9,"created_at":"2024-08-16T07:03:46Z","updated_at":"2024-08-27T15:51:07Z","closed_at":null,"author_association":"MEMBER","active_lock_reason":null,"body":"Depends on https://github.com/ubiquity/safe.ubq.fi/pull/2\r\n\r\nRight now `safe.ubq.fi` is able to generate EOA address from a passkey but doesn't save it to a database.\r\n\r\nThis way user has to perform an additional registration step:\r\n1.

The suggested approach in #4 is just bundling swap, mint and bridge into a multicall. However that's not viable since CoW Swap operates in an asynchronous way, you don't get your tokens as soon as you send a swap transaction, a relayer has to send your order to solvers and then it settles which can take up to minutes. This also means that we must track potentially multiple orders at the same time in our backend without mixing, which needs extra care. Another super delicate case is order expiration: what if CoW Swap fails to resolve the swap in sufficient time? The solution should return funds in that case and should warn possible failure based on pool liquidity even before the user submits a transaction.","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ubiquity/uusd.ubq.fi/issues/7/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ubiquity/uusd.ubq.fi/issues/7/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ubiquity/uusd.ubq.fi/issues/4","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ubiquity/uusd.ubq.fi","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ubiquity/uusd.ubq.fi/issues/4/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ubiquity/uusd.ubq.fi/issues/4/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ubiquity/uusd.ubq.fi/issues/4/events","html_url":"https://github.com/ubiquity/uusd.ubq.fi/issues/4","id":2551390532,"node_id":"I_kwDOMhAZP86YEyFE","number":4,"title":"Ubiquity Banking On-Ramp Experience (*.eth -> UUSD.gno)","user":{"login":"0x4007","id":4975670,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ5NzU2NzA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4975670?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/0x4007","html_url":"https://github.com/0x4007","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/0x4007/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/0x4007/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/0x4007/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/0x4007/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/0x4007/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/0x4007/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/0x4007/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/0x4007/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/0x4007/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":7306247565,"node_id":"LA_kwDOMhAZP88AAAABs3x9jQ","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ubiquity/uusd.ubq.fi/labels/Time:%20%3C1%20Week","name":"Time: <1 Week","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null},{"id":7306247727,"node_id":"LA_kwDOMhAZP88AAAABs3x-Lw","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ubiquity/uusd.ubq.fi/labels/Priority:%203%20(High)","name":"Priority: 3 (High)","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null},{"id":7453409636,"node_id":"LA_kwDOMhAZP88AAAABvEIBZA","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ubiquity/uusd.ubq.fi/labels/Price:%201200%20USD","name":"Price: 1200 USD","color":"1f883d","default":false,"description":null}],"state":"open","locked":false,"assignee":{"login":"zugdev","id":155616000,"node_id":"U_kgDOCUaDAA","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/155616000?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zugdev","html_url":"https://github.com/zugdev","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zugdev/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zugdev/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zugdev/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zugdev/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zugdev/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zugdev/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zugdev/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zugdev/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zugdev/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"zugdev","id":155616000,"node_id":"U_kgDOCUaDAA","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/155616000?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zugdev","html_url":"https://github.com/zugdev","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zugdev/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zugdev/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zugdev/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zugdev/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zugdev/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zugdev/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zugdev/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zugdev/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zugdev/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"milestone":null,"comments":27,"created_at":"2024-09-26T19:33:25Z","updated_at":"2024-10-14T02:10:31Z","closed_at":null,"author_association":"MEMBER","active_lock_reason":null,"body":"> [!CAUTION]\r\n> Make all pages separate HTML pages. Do not page a single page application. This makes maintenance hell. \r\n\r\n### Objective\r\n\r\nCurrently we have some hoops to jump through to mint UUSD and to use on Gnosis Chain: \r\n- acquire 95% LUSD\r\n- acquire 5% UBQ\r\n- mint UUSD\r\n- bridge to Gnosis Chain\r\n\r\nIt would be ideal to abstract this all away from the end user, gas fees and all. \r\n\r\nThe solution would require a combination of smart contracts and UI magic. \r\n\r\n### Minting\r\n\r\nWe can brand it as something that implies a slower process instead of just \"instant minting\" perhaps a term from traditional finance like \"on-ramp to UbiquityOS\" or like a \"bank transfer\" which typically takes a business day (ours I expect to take like 30 minutes.)\r\n\r\nWhen a user starts with any crypto asset in their wallet, like ETH, and wants to mint UUSD to use on Gnosis Chain (starting from mainnet) we need to do the following:\r\n\r\n1. Cowswap order for 95% LUSD, 5% UBQ\r\n2. Transfer the UUSD to Gnosis Bridge\r\n3. Notify the user that their \"Ubiquity Bank Account Balance\" will be updated in approximately 30 minutes. \r\n\r\nWithin the price quote before they begin the process, we need to clearly show in the modal their starting value and, add a clear line item for \"processing fees\" and show their final estimated \"bank balance\" \r\n\r\nThe on-ramping experience makes sense for corporations using UbiquityOS to pay their teams. It would be nice to think of reasons for contributors to use this flow as well. Perhaps to top up their Ubiquity Cards in the future when we support real debit cards. \r\n\r\n### Implementation Steps\r\n- [ ] Create MVP UI\r\n- [ ] Calculate \"Processing Fees\"\r\n\r\n### Remarks\r\n\r\nCore ethos of Ubiquity is to try and abstract as much of the nitty-gritty/tech from the end users. In some years people won't care about \"blockchain\" and \"AI\" instead they care about a wonderful end user experience that solves real problems. \r\n\r\nBear this in mind when implementing.\r\n","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ubiquity/uusd.ubq.fi/issues/4/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ubiquity/uusd.ubq.fi/issues/4/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ubiquity/uusd.ubq.fi/issues/1","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ubiquity/uusd.ubq.fi","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ubiquity/uusd.ubq.fi/issues/1/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ubiquity/uusd.ubq.fi/issues/1/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ubiquity/uusd.ubq.fi/issues/1/events","html_url":"https://github.com/ubiquity/uusd.ubq.fi/issues/1","id":2456119009,"node_id":"I_kwDOMhAZP86SZWbh","number":1,"title":"Create

merged, it would be great to add pricing again, which will automatically allow contributors to `/start` again. \r\n\r\nThis needs to listen to: \r\n1. the issue.closed (as complete) webhook event, and then restore the latest price from the timeline.\r\n2. the issues_comment.created webhook event, to parse the command.","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ubiquity-os-marketplace/daemon-pricing/issues/43/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ubiquity-os-marketplace/daemon-pricing/issues/43/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ubiquity-os-marketplace/daemon-pricing/issues/40","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ubiquity-os-marketplace/daemon-pricing","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ubiquity-os-marketplace/daemon-pricing/issues/40/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ubiquity-os-marketplace/daemon-pricing/issues/40/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ubiquity-os-marketplace/daemon-pricing/issues/40/events","html_url":"https://github.com/ubiquity-os-marketplace/daemon-pricing/issues/40","id":2563882269,"node_id":"I_kwDOLcmjKM6Y0b0d","number":40,"title":"Refactor

This leads to repetitive interactions with each pull request (PR), where we educate them about our organization-wide standards.\r\n\r\nIn other large open-source projects, bots automate initial acknowledgements of standards, such as 'accepting terms and conditions' or signing off on specific practices. I propose a similar automated approach to enforce these standards strictly.\r\n\r\n#### High-Level Enforcement via Bot\r\n- If CI is not green, and a `review_requested` event is triggered, the bot will apply a `requested_changes` review and comment: \"CI has failed and is required before requesting a review.\"\r\n\r\n#### Accommodations for First-Time Contributors\r\n- For first-time contributors, we can utilize an API to determine if this is the contributor's first task, covering anything from `/start` to `closed_as_complete`. Or use a JSON based storage simply for `Username:HasAcknowledgedTerms`, if the user name is not present we request they accept, if it's present standard `/start` flow.\r\n- If a contributor has not `closed_as_complete` or this is their first open PR, we should:\r\n  - Comment on the issue (preferably) or the PR. This ensures they are aware of the guidelines upfront and do not need to backtrack and amend commits.\r\n  - Clearly state our high-level contributing guidelines in the comment. Currently, we lack an official `contributing.md`, but we enforce several unwritten rules such as:\r\n    - Use `yarn`\r\n    - Ensure usage of version `v1.22`\r\n    - Follow conventional commits\r\n    - Always use the formatting scripts provided\r\n\r\n#### Acknowledgement Requirement\r\n- Implement a system where contributors must \"accept\" an acknowledgement of these standards before we assign the issue to them. This process:\r\n  - Saves reviewers time by reducing the need to repeatedly educate on org-wide standards.\r\n  - Improves Developer Experience (DX) as contributors are informed upfront, preventing the need to backtrack significantly on their PRs.\r\n  - Enhances professionalism and presents the project as more official.\r\n  - Helps in filtering out contributors who may find these standards too demanding or complex, ensuring a better fit for the project's needs.\r\n\r\n### Benefits\r\n- **Time Efficiency:** Streamlines the review process by setting clear expectations from the start.\r\n- **Improved DX:** Reduces the burden on new contributors by providing clear guidelines upfront.\r\n- **Professional Image:** Enhances the project's professionalism and operational efficiency.\r\n- **Quality Control:** Helps maintain a high standard of contributions by ensuring all contributors adhere to set practices.\r\n\r\n### This plugin or a new one?\r\n\r\nA dedicated plugin would be great actually as we could allow for a lot more customization of the terms and standards etc by allowing them to pass in their own custom markdown for tables etc as opposed to restricted to using our pretty `/start` message. Decouples from `/start` more but obv still coupled with it slightly. Allows for simpler per-repo customization as you do not have to consider the `/start` setup also.\r\n\r\nThis plugin, really coupled together. The config will become big and messy probably and it adds a whole new branch of functionality to this worker.\r\n\r\nhere is an [example](https://www.github.com/safe-global/safe-smart-account/pull/789#issuecomment-2214809563)","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ubiquity-os-marketplace/command-start-stop/issues/43/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ubiquity-os-marketplace/command-start-stop/issues/43/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ubiquity-os-marketplace/command-start-stop/issues/28","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ubiquity-os-marketplace/command-start-stop","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ubiquity-os-marketplace/command-start-stop/issues/28/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ubiquity-os-marketplace/command-start-stop/issues/28/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ubiquity-os-marketplace/command-start-stop/issues/28/events","html_url":"https://github.com/ubiquity-os-marketplace/command-start-stop/issues/28","id":2489452377,"node_id":"I_kwDOL-In886UYgdZ","number":28,"title":"Properly handle task limit","user":{"login":"whilefoo","id":139262667,"node_id":"U_kgDOCEz6yw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/139262667?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/whilefoo","html_url":"https://github.com/whilefoo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/whilefoo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/whilefoo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/whilefoo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/whilefoo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/whilefoo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/whilefoo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/whilefoo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/whilefoo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/whilefoo/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":7036608750,"node_id":"LA_kwDOL-In888AAAABo2og7g","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ubiquity-os-marketplace/command-start-stop/labels/Time:%20%3C2%20Hours","name":"Time: <2 Hours","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null},{"id":7036609178,"node_id":"LA_kwDOL-In888AAAABo2oimg","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ubiquity-os-marketplace/command-start-stop/labels/Priority:%204%20(Urgent)","name":"Priority: 4 (Urgent)","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null},{"id":7036610424,"node_id":"LA_kwDOL-In888AAAABo2oneA","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ubiquity-os-marketplace/command-start-stop/labels/Price:%20200%20USD","name":"Price: 200 USD","color":"1f883d","default":false,"description":null}],"state":"open","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":0,"created_at":"2024-08-27T13:55:05Z","updated_at":"2024-10-01T17:17:52Z","closed_at":null,"author_association":"NONE","active_lock_reason":null,"body":"              The original implementation allowed for productive contributors to work on two tasks concurrently.

The metadata header schema is as follows:\r\n```\r\n<!-- Ubiquity - CLASSNAME - FUNCTION_CALLER - REVISION\r\n```\r\n`CLASSNAME` a developer defined \"class name\" that can provide useful context of what operation is being performed. \r\n`FUNCTION_CALLER` the name of the function that was run. Could be useful to start investigation for debugging. \r\n`REVISION` no longer works, but was supposed to be a revision hash. \r\n\r\nNow, I think it makes sense to do something like: \r\n\r\n```\r\n<!-- UbiquityOS - Followup - remindAssignees - @ubiquibot/conversation-rewards@9de94e814df3dbf0829cb5d072979bc36fee3dd7\r\n```\r\n1. Ubiquity -> UbiquityOS\r\n2. Revision hash clearly states the plugin name and the revision hash. We used to do shorthand revision hash, not sure if that is better than the full one.

We can do per file or on the function level, depending on which has better performance.\n\nI asked GPT for the best sorting method on the [embedding leaderboard](https://huggingface.co/spaces/mteb/leaderboard). \n\nLater it clarified that we should be sorting by \"retrieval with instructions\" for best results. \n\n[FollowIR-7B](https://huggingface.co/jhu-clsp/FollowIR-7B) is the highest ranked. \n\nWe should be doing this in two steps:\n1. Primarily, we should be generating embeddings of the new files when pull requests are merged.\n2. We should have a tool that we can run manually (manual dispatch on GitHub actions ok) to generate all the embeddings. This would be expected to be used if there were pushes directly to the default branch and were not added via pull request\n\n### additional context\n\n> For this use case (codebase question-answering), your focus should be on retrieval tasks. Based on the criteria provided, here’s how I would prioritize the metrics:\n\n> 1. **Retrieval Average (15 datasets)**: This should be your highest priority. The better the retrieval capability of the model, the more relevant code chunks it will retrieve when you ask a question about the codebase.\n\n> 2. **Embedding Dimensions**: A higher embedding dimension may provide more nuanced representations of code and questions, improving retrieval accuracy. However, this needs to be balanced with memory usage and model size.\n\n> 3. **Model Size (Million Parameters)**: Larger models tend to perform better in generating high-quality embeddings, but at the cost of memory and speed. Consider how much memory and computational power you can afford.\n\n> 4. **Max Tokens**: A higher max token limit is useful for code because some functions or files can be quite large. You'll want a model that can handle bigger chunks of code.\n\n> 5. **Classification Average (12 datasets)**: Code-related tasks sometimes involve classification (e.g., determining the type of question or identifying sections of code). A higher classification score can help in such scenarios.\n\n> 6. **STS Average (10 datasets)**: Semantic Textual Similarity (STS) is also important as it measures how well the embeddings capture semantic meaning, which is useful for understanding the context and retrieving the right code section.\n\n> ### Sorting Criteria:\n> Sort by **Retrieval Average** first, then consider **Max Tokens** and **Embedding Dimensions** for practical handling of code and performance optimization.\n\n> The other metrics like **Classification**, **Clustering**, and **Reranking** are less critical for your specific use case, but they can help refine the quality if you have a secondary need for such tasks.","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ubiquity-os-marketplace/text-vector-embeddings/issues/10/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ubiquity-os-marketplace/text-vector-embeddings/issues/10/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ubiquity-os-marketplace/text-vector-embeddings/issues/5","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ubiquity-os-marketplace/text-vector-embeddings","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ubiquity-os-marketplace/text-vector-embeddings/issues/5/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ubiquity-os-marketplace/text-vector-embeddings/issues/5/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ubiquity-os-marketplace/text-vector-embeddings/issues/5/events","html_url":"https://github.com/ubiquity-os-marketplace/text-vector-embeddings/issues/5","id":2501678538,"node_id":"I_kwDOMoorW86VHJXK","number":5,"title":"Use the batch API","user":{"login":"Keyrxng","id":106303466,"node_id":"U_kgDOBlYP6g","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/106303466?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Keyrxng","html_url":"https://github.com/Keyrxng","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Keyrxng/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Keyrxng/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Keyrxng/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Keyrxng/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Keyrxng/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Keyrxng/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Keyrxng/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Keyrxng/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Keyrxng/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"open","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":2,"created_at":"2024-09-02T23:22:08Z","updated_at":"2024-09-03T04:23:25Z","closed_at":null,"author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","active_lock_reason":null,"body":"We could use the batch API and reap the benefits it provides since right now we do not need the real-time embeddings that we currently have, which is awesome but more expensive than what it needs to be.\r\n\r\nSo we'd simply store each comment as they come in as is what happens now, then send all comments in the database without an embedding every n hours.\r\n\r\nWe could have a cron job perform this function for us but it would need to be able to handle the async nature of requests to this endpoint.

We can use the same color keys but instead of diff syntax, we use this syntax. \r\n\r\nThis should be applied across all kernel and plugin messages.\r\n\r\nIt might even be handy to rename the methods in our logger if its still attached to posting comments.

These codes are grouped into five classes, each signifying a different category of response:\r\n>\r\n> ---\r\n> \r\n> ### **1xx: Informational**\r\n> \r\n> **Description:** The 1xx class of status codes indicates that the server has received the request and is continuing the process. These are provisional responses, providing interim information while the server continues to process the request.\r\n> \r\n> **Common Status Codes:**\r\n> \r\n> - **100 Continue:** Indicates that the initial part of the request has been received and the client should continue with the rest of the request.\r\n> - **101 Switching Protocols:** Informs the client that the server is switching to a different protocol as requested.\r\n> - **102 Processing (WebDAV):** Signals that the server has received and is processing the request, but no response is available yet.\r\n> \r\n> ---\r\n> \r\n> ### **2xx: Success**\r\n> \r\n> **Description:** The 2xx class signifies that the client's request was successfully received, understood, and accepted by the server.\r\n> \r\n> **Common Status Codes:**\r\n> \r\n> - **200 OK:** The request has succeeded. The meaning varies depending on the HTTP method used.\r\n> - **201 Created:** The request has been fulfilled, resulting in the creation of a new resource.\r\n> - **202 Accepted:** The request has been accepted for processing, but the processing is not complete.\r\n> - **204 No Content:** The server successfully processed the request and is not returning any content.\r\n> - **206 Partial Content:** The server is delivering only part of the resource due to a range header sent by the client.\r\n> \r\n> ---\r\n> \r\n> ### **3xx: Redirection**\r\n> \r\n> **Description:** The 3xx class indicates that further action is needed to complete the request. This usually means a redirection to a different resource.\r\n> \r\n> **Common Status Codes:**\r\n> \r\n> - **301 Moved Permanently:** The resource has been permanently moved to a new URL.\r\n> - **302 Found:** The resource resides temporarily under a different URL.\r\n> - **303 See Other:** The response can be found under a different URI and should be retrieved using a GET method.\r\n> - **304 Not Modified:** Indicates that the resource has not been modified since the last request.\r\n> - **307 Temporary Redirect:** The request should be repeated with another URI; however, future requests should still use the original URI.\r\n> \r\n> ---\r\n> \r\n> ### **4xx: Client Error**\r\n> \r\n> **Description:** The 4xx class signifies errors that appear to have been caused by the client. These codes indicate that the request contains bad syntax or cannot be fulfilled.\r\n> \r\n> **Common Status Codes:**\r\n> \r\n> - **400 Bad Request:** The server cannot process the request due to a client error (e.g., malformed request syntax).\r\n> - **401 Unauthorized:** Authentication is required and has failed or has not yet been provided.\r\n> - **403 Forbidden:** The client does not have access rights to the content.\r\n> - **404 Not Found:** The server cannot find the requested resource.\r\n> - **405 Method Not Allowed:** The request method is known by the server but is not supported by the target resource.\r\n> - **408 Request Timeout:** The server timed out waiting for the request.\r\n> - **409 Conflict:** The request could not be completed due to a conflict with the current state of the resource.\r\n> - **410 Gone:** The resource requested is no longer available and will not be available again.\r\n> - **429 Too Many Requests:** The user has sent too many requests in a given amount of time (\"rate limiting\").\r\n> \r\n> ---\r\n> \r\n> ### **5xx: Server Error**\r\n> \r\n> **Description:** The 5xx class indicates that the server failed to fulfill a valid request. The server is aware that it has encountered an error or is otherwise incapable of performing the request.\r\n> \r\n> **Common Status Codes:**\r\n> \r\n> - **500 Internal Server Error:** A generic error message when the server encounters an unexpected condition.\r\n> - **501 Not Implemented:** The server either does not recognize the request method or lacks the ability to fulfill it.\r\n> - **502 Bad Gateway:** The server was acting as a gateway or proxy and received an invalid response from the upstream server.\r\n> - **503 Service Unavailable:** The server is not ready to handle the request, often due to maintenance or overload.\r\n> - **504 Gateway Timeout:** The server was acting as a gateway or proxy and did not receive a timely response from the upstream server.\r\n> - **505 HTTP Version Not Supported:** The server does not support the HTTP protocol version used in the request.\r\n> \r\n> ---\r\n> \r\n> Understanding these status codes is essential for debugging web applications and ensuring efficient client-server communication. Each code provides specific information about what happened with a request, allowing developers to handle responses appropriately.\r\n\r\n### Original Context\r\n\r\n> [!WARNING]\r\n> Failed to run

After investigating, it seems that the combination of the wildcard event (`'*'`) with an Action was the cause. What happens is the following:\r\n- the kernel receives a webhook event, say a `push` event\r\n- the kernel dispatches that event to plugins located within `'*'`\r\n- the action starts, say `user-activity-watcher`\r\n- this summons the Github webhook that sends a `workflow_started` event to the kernel\r\n- kernel dispatches that event to `'*'`\r\n- action starts again\r\n\r\nand so on, creating the loop. It doesn't happen with Workers because they don't trigger any event within Github when they are run.\r\n\r\nI think this highlights the dangers of subscribing Actions to that wildcard. Maybe we should consider removing it and changing the way we configure plugins. My idea was to have a `allow | forbid` list where we can configure which events to react to, or which events to ignore, per plugin in the configuration file. Now that we are working on the [manifest feature](https://github.com/ubiquity/ubiquibot-kernel/issues/58), we could even allow plugin creators to set some defaults there, that we can eventually override within the configuration.\r\n\r\nHowever despite these changes we would not be safe from infinite loops (for example, a plugin posting a comment when the event comment posting is triggered).

The cause we are discussing is a collision with dependency IDs. And whether there are real-world scenarios where configurations might lead to duplicate dependencies. \r\n\r\nFrom my experience creating GitHub Actions CI scripts, I haven't encountered situations where adding redundant dependencies was necessary.

See [this comment](https://github.com/ubiquity/ubiquibot-kernel/pull/47#issuecomment-2154146051) for a suggestion on how to handle that.\r\n\r\n_Originally posted by @0x4007 in https://github.com/ubiquity/ubiquibot-kernel/issues/47#issuecomment-2162159354_\r\n            ","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ubiquity-os/ubiquity-os-kernel/issues/54/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ubiquity-os/ubiquity-os-kernel/issues/54/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ubiquity-os/ubiquity-os-kernel/issues/41","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ubiquity-os/ubiquity-os-kernel","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ubiquity-os/ubiquity-os-kernel/issues/41/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ubiquity-os/ubiquity-os-kernel/issues/41/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ubiquity-os/ubiquity-os-kernel/issues/41/events","html_url":"https://github.com/ubiquity-os/ubiquity-os-kernel/issues/41","id":2304370599,"node_id":"I_kwDOK6Xdq86JWeen","number":41,"title":"Parsing Org config","user":{"login":"Keyrxng","id":106303466,"node_id":"U_kgDOBlYP6g","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/106303466?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Keyrxng","html_url":"https://github.com/Keyrxng","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Keyrxng/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Keyrxng/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Keyrxng/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Keyrxng/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Keyrxng/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Keyrxng/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Keyrxng/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Keyrxng/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Keyrxng/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"open","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":0,"created_at":"2024-05-19T01:24:18Z","updated_at":"2024-05-19T01:31:03Z","closed_at":null,"author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","active_lock_reason":null,"body":"It used to be the case that the org config was parsed as well.

Ideal if it can batch similar tasks aiming for between 1 hour and 1 day within the same GitHub issue (I think this is possible with my experience working with Claude 3.5 Sonnet.)\r\n\r\n### Implementation\r\n\r\nThe way that this can work is if we leave the review state as \"commented\" and leave comments that seem like we want changes to be done. These will need to be understood by the OS. \r\n\r\nIf we really think the changes are critical to be done in the current pull, then we must be sure to \"request changes.\" \r\n\r\n### Remarks\r\n\r\nI am concerned that it might be too quick to fire off new issues, so ideally we have it understand that there is a possibly already created \"post pull request review\" task, and to continue batching everything from the review in that task (we could standardize the naming scheme of the generated issue.) \r\n\r\nWe may possibly need to check for pull request closed and merged to process the full conversation and fire off new tasks.  This will allow us room to determine the necessity of such suggestions. \r\n\r\n###### Similar [^01^]\n\n[^01^]: [2025 Plugins Wishlist](https://www.github.com/ubiquity-os/plugins-wishlist/issues/52) 81%","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ubiquity-os/plugins-wishlist/issues/53/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ubiquity-os/plugins-wishlist/issues/53/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ubiquity-os/plugins-wishlist/issues/52","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ubiquity-os/plugins-wishlist","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ubiquity-os/plugins-wishlist/issues/52/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ubiquity-os/plugins-wishlist/issues/52/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ubiquity-os/plugins-wishlist/issues/52/events","html_url":"https://github.com/ubiquity-os/plugins-wishlist/issues/52","id":2559820984,"node_id":"I_kwDOLf0nHM6Yk8S4","number":52,"title":"2025 Plugins Wishlist","user":{"login":"0x4007","id":4975670,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ5NzU2NzA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4975670?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/0x4007","html_url":"https://github.com/0x4007","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/0x4007/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/0x4007/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/0x4007/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/0x4007/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/0x4007/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/0x4007/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/0x4007/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/0x4007/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/0x4007/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"open","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":2,"created_at":"2024-10-01T17:33:40Z","updated_at":"2024-10-01T19:05:48Z","closed_at":null,"author_association":"MEMBER","active_lock_reason":null,"body":"### From @ubiquity/ubiquibot\r\n\r\n- https://github.com/ubiquity/ubiquibot/issues/394 -

have waves of contributors that open pulls sometimes keeping our review team busy. \n\nWe can save valuable man hours by having the bot preemptively check if the pull achieves the specification. \n\n### Pull Flow\n\n1. Assuming that the contributor follows directions, the pull must be initially opened up as a draft. \n2. When it is ready for review, they should turn it into a finalized pull request. \n3. The bot should consume the issue specification and then the pull diff into its context. \n4. The bot should return actionable feedback for what is missing from the specification. It should leave the review state as requested changes. It should also convert the pull back into a draft. However if it passes, it should leave as just \"commented\" (not approval). \n5. If a collaborator (reviewer on the team) converts the pull back from a draft into a finalized pull, then the bot should back off and stop intervening. Basically the inspection should only occur on pull.created and when it's converted from draft to finalized by the pull author. \n\nBonus but maybe can be handled in other tasks:\n\n1.

Limits: some novice contributors might abuse the code review feature and burn out credits by continuously requesting reviews every time they make a tiny change that doesn't achieve the specification.

was reading my friends [blog post](https://transitivebullsh.it/agentic-spectrum) and was inspired to think about AI systems in a more structured way. They have these AI \"level\" designations. \n\nIt would be interesting to make an L2 agent according to the definition in the blog post:\n\n> L2 agents use LLMs selectively to decide how to handle key points in the program’s control flow.\n> Today, this often boils down to deciding which tool to invoke based on a set of tools which have been carefully curated by a human programmer.\n> The most common example of L2 agents today is invoking an LLM with access to tools in a while loop.\n> The majority of the program’s control flow still resides outside of the LLM’s purview and is controlled by a human programmer.\n\nThis is a stepping stone to L3 according to the blog because L3 coordinates L2 and below. \n\n---\n\nWe can make this a command interface where we can tag the bot and ask for requests in plain language:\n\n@ubiquity-os give me the wallet address of @0x4007 \n\n---\n\nIn the above example, we should pass the entire help menu to ChatGPT and it can invoke the correct plugin based on the command description. \n\nI think this should be quite straightforward to implement, and is a useful stepping stone towards a more advanced AI powered system.\n\nWe can use ChatGPT 4o mini because this seems pretty simple to just look at the help menu.  \n\n### Advanced Version\n\nAs a more advanced version of this plugin, we can listen for every comment (no bot tag required) and the bot can jump in to help if it thinks it can based on any comment. For example, if somebody asks to be assigned to a task, perhaps the bot can somehow invoke /start on behalf of that user (which inherits all of the checks, like if they are already assigned to too many other open tasks etc) \n\nThis makes the bot's presence much more pronounced, and it will truly feel like a helpful, and proactive member of the team instead of \"a tool\" that must be specifically called upon for help. \n\n### Remark\n\nI suppose if it calls other plugins with LLMs (like conversation rewards, somehow) then technically this would be considered an L3 class system.

The goal is to ensure sales personnel are paid based on their performance, which includes:\r\n1. Taking scheduled calls (and being on time)\r\n2. Covering key points on the calls\r\n3. Handling follow-up tasks\r\n\r\nThis integration focuses on managing investor relations associates who pitch high-level information about Ubiquity DAO Series A round to prospective investors.\r\n\r\n## Background\r\nOur communications team consists of lead generation and investor relations associates. Investor relations associates take the first wave of investor candidates, pitch the high-level overview of Ubiquity, and loop in the technical team for detailed due diligence if the investors are interested. Associates follow a script regarding the investment opportunity while focusing on relationship building with the investors.\r\n\r\nRead.AI records Zoom calls and generates summaries, including post-call action items. We aim to automate task assignment and management for salespersons by creating GitHub issues for follow-up tasks based on Read.AI's analysis.\r\n\r\n## 1/3 Taking the Scheduled Calls\r\nThe basic function of their job is to make it to the scheduled calls. The lead generation team, familiar with setting up webhooks, can send information about when a call is booked and whose calendar it is on. They also monitor when bookings are rescheduled, which could be useful to capture.\r\n\r\nBy cross-referencing the call start and end times, we can easily determine if the associate attended the scheduled call.\r\n\r\n## 2/3 Covering Key Points\r\nAssociates must communicate key points to qualify the investor candidate. Important points to cover include:\r\n- Series A $10-$20m raise at $100-$200m valuation (explain the valuation strategy)\r\n- Kernel-plugin architecture and the potential for an \"Apple App Store\" of agents\r\n- MakerDAO partnership\r\n- Card issuance\r\n- Stablecoin history\r\n\r\n### Sales Team Key Points to Emphasize\r\nFrom the [Sales Team Handbook](https://docs.google.com/document/d/13HR8GgPq0zHfr74YwYotRQaC3Fzxio4CGgBpw31Jg1I/edit):\r\n- Series A fundraising specifics and timeline\r\n- Current financial status and previous seed round details\r\n- Overview of the Ubiquity Operating System and its benefits\r\n- Dynamic compensation system for improved productivity\r\n- Potential revenue streams and current stage of monetization\r\n- Commitment to open-source and efficient global team management\r\n- Unique value proposition and competitive advantages\r\n- Plans for partnerships and pilot programs\r\n- Clear closing with an invitation for further engagement\r\n\r\nRead.AI summarizes what points were covered, and we can run it through another ChatGPT prompt to identify any points that were not hit, according to the Read.AI payload.\r\n\r\n## 3/3 Handling Follow-Up Tasks\r\nRead.AI generates a bullet point list of follow-up tasks, including the Zoom username per task. We can extract these follow-up tasks and assign them to the associate on GitHub as separate issues. One issue per week with all the follow-up tasks could be created, with default priority and time levels set, so that when tasks are completed, associates can receive a reward.\r\n\r\n## Example Read.AI Payload\r\n\r\n```json\r\n{\r\n    \"payload\": {\r\n        \"session_id\": \"01HZJ1FY5RRM6NR0W87J5ZBHC1\",\r\n        \"trigger\": \"meeting_end\",\r\n        \"title\": \"Meet Meeting\",\r\n        \"start_time\": \"2024-06-04T16:32:28+00:00\",\r\n        \"end_time\": \"2024-06-04T17:47:25+00:00\",\r\n        \"participants\": [\r\n            {\r\n                \"name\": \"アレクサンダー\",\r\n                \"first_name\": \"アレクサンダー\",\r\n                \"last_name\": null,\r\n                \"email\": null\r\n            },\r\n            {\r\n                \"name\": \"K77 Dewhales\",\r\n                \"first_name\": \"K77\",\r\n                \"last_name\": \"Dewhales\",\r\n                \"email\": null\r\n            },\r\n            {\r\n                \"name\": \"[redacted]\",\r\n                \"first_name\": \"[redacted]\",\r\n                \"last_name\": null,\r\n                \"email\": \"[redacted]\"\r\n            }\r\n        ],\r\n        \"owner\": {\r\n            \"name\": \"[redacted]\",\r\n            \"first_name\": \"[redacted]\",\r\n            \"last_name\": null,\r\n            \"email\": \"[redacted]\"\r\n        },\r\n        \"summary\": \"The meeting began with Alexander discussing his transition from a developer to focusing on fundraising, highlighting the challenges faced with existing investors and the strategy behind the previous seed round.

They detailed the collective decision-making process involving over 200 members with a combined portfolio of 350 million, the comprehensive VC structure, advisory services, liquidity provision capabilities, connections to portfolio companies and partners, and the meticulous voting and pledge phases for project approval and investment. \\n\\nAlexander provided insights into the fundraising strategy, highlighting the original window for fundraising and the need to refine pitch materials and onboard investor relations associates. He also delved into the potential partnership with Microsoft's fund for GitHub, emphasizing the importance of open source products in encouraging new developers to join the movement. Additionally, he explained the impact of the Bitcoin halving cycle on the fundraising timeline and the objective to secure partners unaffected by the price of Bitcoin.\\n\\nThe meeting also covered Ubiquity's future plans and funding strategy, including the development of an on-chain neobank with a stablecoin, aiming to build an ecosystem of useful applications and incentivize settlement in their stablecoin. Alexander elaborated on the plan to offer banking services, such as providing lines of credit based on users' income and offering prepaid Visa and Mastercards with no KYC requirements, which can be used for cashing out or making payments via mobile wallets.

Let's call them DevRels.\r\n\r\nThe vision is to generate a new permit for the DevRel upon task completion. \r\n- It is unclear to me exactly how to do default pricing (flat fee, percentage) \r\n- It can be easy to game and squeeze out extra rewards with a self referral unless the DevRel's cut is zero sum from the developer. If it is zero sum, then a percentage would be safest i.e. 5% or 10%. What is the highest percentage we can go before developers get annoyed? Perhaps we can also set a max cap, like 50 USD per reward in addition to the percentage. For example, if a developer receives a 1000 USD reward, perhaps the DevRel cap can be max 50 USD. \r\n- I fear the rewards may not be very competitive. We can consider high (non zero sum) rewards in the short term to kick things off, then switch it to zero sum mode later.\r\n- We should also consider a reward for every developer referred (this may be implemented as a separate tool though, because it seems incompatible with the percentage or zero sum system)\r\n\r\n### Configuration Requirements\r\n\r\n- For version one, lets go only with percentages support. Make sure that the percentage is configurable. \r\n   - This will keep things simple in case the DevRel earns a tiny reward for leaving a small comment etc.\r\n- Make sure that we can toggle zero sum mode (subtract from developer reward to pay the DevRel.) \r\n\r\n### Implementation Overview\r\n\r\nWe can do this in a couple of parts:\r\n1. the new referral logs in with GitHub at `work.ubq.fi?ref=[github user id of DevRel]` \r\n2. we associate in a KV store the key being the DevRel GitHub ID and the value being an array of DevRel values. \r\n```typescript\r\ntype GitHubId = number;\r\ntype KV = { [key: GitHubId]: GitHubId[] };\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis feels a little parasitic if a developer accidentally clicks a DevRel's link at some point in the future, especially if they start losing some of their rewards. I think we need some type of system to \"undo\" a referral.

For example:\r\n\r\n```yml\r\nplugins:\r\n  - uses:\r\n    - plugin: ubiquity-os-marketplace/ubiquity-os-agent\r\n      with:\r\n        target: ubiquity-os-agent\r\n```\r\n\r\nThen comments starting with `@0x4007` will relay the full `issues_comment.created` payload to `0x4007/ubiquity-os-agent`\r\n\r\n# Context\r\n\r\nThis one I'm very excited about. The vision here is that we can make custom user \"agents\" (i.e. plugins with LLMs) that are hosted by the user's GitHub (so they can modify it) and will automate actions for the user (with their PAT to authorize as them) with the full context of a particular repository/organization.  \r\n\r\n- We make a repository that power users are intended to fork, for example `@ubiquibot/personal-agent` -> `@pavlovcik/personal-agent`\r\n- A repository/organization configures personal agents command to be `/@<user's name>` `/@pavlovcik` maybe something like that. This should also support arguments, for example a sentence that can be parsed by an LLM `/@pavlovcik review my pull #123`\r\n   - This technically would allow other users to invoke other user's agents. We can easily see if the invoker is an \"authorized\" user by checking the event context, and hard coding authorized users (self) in the boilerplate plugin code. \r\n   - I wonder if it would be more useful if we just look for comments that start with a username tag instead, it might be more natural to set up automations for common questions/requests i.e. `@pavlovcik can i work on this issue?` then my agent, with my PAT, and my custom prompt saying what to do in this situation, would just automatically assign them and explain the `/start` command.\r\n- The kernel will invoke a request (and pass all parameters) to that user's plugin/agent (hosted at `@username/personal-agent` actions)\r\n- The user can grant access to their PAT from their agent, allowing the agent to act on behalf of the owner inheriting their permissions. \r\n\r\nThere are some ways we can make the template code which will be forked:\r\n1. simple starting point would be just template/boilerplate that doesn't do anything\r\n2. code makes a call to an LLM (we could even run a small model locally on the GitHub Action runner potentially in order to make dealing with credentials/API keys more hands off, at the tradeoff of it being dumber than ChatGPT etc but decentralization/free is cool)\r\n   1. this LLM has a big prompt in the template that explains the context (you're running in a github action runner and a user invoked you from this repo...) and its capabilities (we can provide some local functions from our SDK that it can invoke to perform specific tasks by using an authenticated octokit instance using the person's PAT. It also receives all of the context of the event invocation (which user called the function, what repository and organization is it coming in from? possibly even scraping all the linked issues and pull requests for more context)\r\n      2. If we can reliably get the LLM to write working code with Octokit (or just raw CURLs with the PAT) then we can have a context aware and english language input to any function a user can perform on GitHub (limited to the PAT permissions) which is quite interesting. \r\n      3. The user can \"fine-tune\" their LLM by adding extra details and preferences to their prompt in their forked code. I imagine that I would continue to add new sections as I see repetitive questions/queries.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nAssuming that the org config enables support for personal agents, technically we can extend personal agent capabilities beyond GitHub. Generic telegram example: `@pavlovcik send me the credentials on Telegram @username` with the right code in my personal agent, the GitHub Action can send information to their Telegram. All invoked from the GitHub Action runner!\r\n\r\nThis could make plugin development a lot more exciting and rapid. If the team all works on their own agents, and tests them in production, we could extract useful bits from eachothers' and release \"official\" plugins which may normally have slower r&d cycles. \r\n\r\nIn the further future, our kernel can support webhooks coming in from other services (like Telegram) and invoke user agents which can be a very powerful architecture for platform composability. For example, a bot call (can be \"inline\" in a dm to someone as well) that will pass along the conversation context to our kernel, then to a user's personal agent (github action) back to kernel and then back to Telegram\r\n\r\n### Notes for @pavlovcik/personal-agent\r\n\r\n- I want to make use of the XP system (as an admin) to soft incentivize/disincentivize behaviors. \r\n   - Prompt follow ups: there are situations where I tag team members for input and they take days to reply. I think if they take longer than 24 hours to reply, I would want to dock XP, and include an automated follow up (perhaps even on Telegram dm!) High performing team members generally reply promptly. XP can be used as a heartbeat for how actively engaged the contributor is, and how well they are performing, which is important for performance evaluations regarding base pay. \r\n   - On the other end of the spectrum: unnecessary tags[^1^]. If I make it clear to team members that I am around to help but more for emergencies, I would appreciate not being pinged on things unless its essential. Would be interesting to make a personal agent that will automatically reply (like an away message) explaining this, while also scrubbing out the tag from their message. Assuming it is during my awake/working hours, I would still receive a push notification on my device from the original tag. \r\n\r\n## Planned Capabilities\r\n\r\n### Comment rewrites:\r\n\r\nFrom my phone sometimes writing comments can be arduous with the custom vocabulary we use and the autocorrect. A simple agent that will save me from a lot of frustration is to edit my comments posted, and correct any typos when I post from my phone. \r\n\r\n### Review and follow up:\r\n\r\nSometimes a pull request will be 99% of the way there. It will be something like \"just make sure CI passes\" or \"fix merge conflicts\" \r\n\r\nIdeally the personal agent should monitor pulls that I approved and are still opened. If I said something like this, and if those conditions are met, it should merge the pull. \r\n\r\n- Example: https://github.com/ubiquity-os/plugin-template/pull/23#issuecomment-2391416311\r\n\r\n[^1^]: Although it is not clear to me how we can capture the event from this. I suppose I would need to manually add in the org/repo config for `issue_comment.created`.\r\n\r\n###### Similar [^01^]\r\n\r\n[^01^]: [2025 Plugins Wishlist](https://www.github.com/ubiquity-os/plugins-wishlist/issues/52) 84%\r\n[^02^]: [New Task Or Edit Pull Arbiter](https://www.github.com/ubiquity-os/plugins-wishlist/issues/53) 82%","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ubiquity-os/plugins-wishlist/issues/3/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ubiquity-os/plugins-wishlist/issues/3/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ubiquity-os/plugins-wishlist/issues/2","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ubiquity-os/plugins-wishlist","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ubiquity-os/plugins-wishlist/issues/2/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ubiquity-os/plugins-wishlist/issues/2/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ubiquity-os/plugins-wishlist/issues/2/events","html_url":"https://github.com/ubiquity-os/plugins-wishlist/issues/2","id":2204223494,"node_id":"I_kwDOLf0nHM6DYcgG","number":2,"title":"Rewrite Specification","user":{"login":"0x4007","id":4975670,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ5NzU2NzA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4975670?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/0x4007","html_url":"https://github.com/0x4007","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/0x4007/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/0x4007/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/0x4007/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/0x4007/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/0x4007/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/0x4007/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/0x4007/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/0x4007/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/0x4007/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":6922609484,"node_id":"LA_kwDOLf0nHM8AAAABnJ6jTA","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ubiquity-os/plugins-wishlist/labels/Time:%20%3C1%20Week","name":"Time: <1 Week","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null},{"id":6922609500,"node_id":"LA_kwDOLf0nHM8AAAABnJ6jXA","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ubiquity-os/plugins-wishlist/labels/Priority:%201%20(Normal)","name":"Priority: 1 (Normal)","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null},{"id":7191503619,"node_id":"LA_kwDOLf0nHM8AAAABrKWjAw","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ubiquity-os/plugins-wishlist/labels/Price:%20200%20USD","name":"Price: 200 USD","color":"1f883d","default":false,"description":null}],"state":"open","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":11,"created_at":"2024-03-24T07:27:00Z","updated_at":"2024-09-08T03:29:20Z","closed_at":null,"author_association":"MEMBER","active_lock_reason":null,"body":"Sometimes issues are submitted but not finalized until the team contributes more ideas and research.

An additional benefit is that this allows partners full control over their data and decentralizes the data storage.\r\n\r\n## Specification\r\n\r\n### Storage Structure\r\n- Each plug-in will have its own JSON database file.\r\n- The filename of each JSON database will be the plug-in ID.\r\n- This ensures that plug-ins cannot tamper with each other's data.\r\n\r\n### JSON Database Format\r\n- Each JSON file will store data specific to its corresponding plug-in.\r\n- The structure within the JSON file is determined by the plug-in's requirements.\r\n\r\n### Example\r\nFor a plug-in with ID `@ubiquibot/command-start-stop`, the JSON file will be named `ubiquibot-command-start-stop.json`.\r\n\r\n```json\r\n{\r\n    \"dataKey1\": \"value1\",\r\n    \"dataKey2\": \"value2\",\r\n    ...\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Access Control\r\n- The kernel will manage read and write permissions.\r\n- Write access will be restricted to ensure plug-ins can only modify their own JSON file.\r\n- Read access can be granted based on plug-in ID, allowing access to other plug-ins' data as needed.\r\n\r\n### Implementation\r\n1. **Repository Setup**\r\n    - Use the `.ubiquibot-config` repository as the general-purpose utility repository per organization.\r\n    - Configure GitHub App permissions to allow the kernel to manage repository access.\r\n\r\n2. **Kernel Configuration**\r\n    - Ensure the kernel has write access to the repository.\r\n    - Implement read access control based on plug-in IDs.\r\n\r\n### Security Considerations\r\n- Restrict write permissions to prevent unauthorized modifications.\r\n\r\n### GitHub App Permissions\r\n- The kernel requires the following GitHub App permissions:\r\n    - Read and write access to the configuration repository.\r\n\r\n## Benefits\r\n- **Data Integrity and Security**: By isolating each plug-in's data in its own JSON file, we ensure that plug-ins cannot interfere with each other’s data.\r\n- **Partner Control**: Partners have full control over their data, enhancing privacy and security.\r\n- **Decentralized Storage**: Decentralizing data storage minimizes the risk of data breaches and central points of failure.\r\n- **Simplified Development**: Standardizing data storage eliminates the need to handle different data providers when developing plugins. Methods in our SDK will make it simple for plugin developers to store and access data.\r\n\r\n## Summary\r\nBy standardizing the storage of plug-in data in separate JSON files named after the plug-in ID, we ensure data integrity and security. The kernel will manage access control, providing a robust framework for plug-in data management, and simplifying the development process for plugin
